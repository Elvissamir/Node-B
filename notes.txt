- NODE IS A RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT FOR EXECUTING JAVASCRIPT CODE.

- JS ENGINE CONVERTS JS CODE TO MACHINE CODE.

- NODE USES THE V8 ENGINE.

- NODE does not use the DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL), instead it provides
some additional modules.

- NODE has the global object, and it has some of the methods that can 
be used with the window object in browsers. Some examples: 

* global.console.log()
* global.setInterval()

- Files are considered as MODULES in NODE. The variables and functions
defined in a file are scoped to that file. If you want to use a variable
or function from that module you have to export it and make it public.

- The MODULE object in NODE represents the current module, and contains
information as: id, path, exports, filename, loaded, children, paths.

- The MODULE object property "exports" represents the parts 
(variables, objects) of the module that can be accessed in other
files.

- To export parts (variables, objects...) from the MODULE, you can use
the module.exports.property_name. Example: 

module.exports.log = log 
module.exports.url = url
